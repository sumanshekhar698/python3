#Asingment Operators
x = 9 % 5;

y = 34583833838
print(y % 10)
print(x)


x = 5;
y = 3;


print(x**y)# x^y == x**y in Python


x = -8
print(++x)#increment and decrement is not avaiable in Python
print(5/3)
print(8//3)
#Shorthand Operators
x = x + 1
x+=1
x*=2


# There are other operators like Comparison and Arithmetic operators
